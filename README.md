## Hi there!

my name is Austin Hunter. I'm currently studying Computer Science at UNC Charlotte and working toward a career in software engineering. Most of my coursework at UNC Charlotte is done with Java, so you might see some Jave projects here in the future.

If you'd like to reach me, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/austinfhunter/). I also have a [blog](https://www.austinhunter.dev/) where I'll be posting about things I'm learning or topics I am interested in.

I enjoy expirementing with new languages and frameworks, so I'll likely be maintaining a diverse assortment of personal projects here. I have a solid understanding of Go, Javascript, and most of the front-end (HTML, CSS, React), but I'm always trying to learn more.

I am currently learning/expirementing with:
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
* [Redis](https://redis.com/)

I hope to be able to continue tinkering and learning, as well as make impactful contributions to open source projects in the future.
