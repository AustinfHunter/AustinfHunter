## Hi there!

my name is Austin Hunter. I'm currently studying Computer Science at UNC Charlotte and working toward a career in software engineering. Most of my coursework at UNC Charlotte is done with Java, so you might see some Jave projects here in the future.

If you'd like to reach me, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/austinfhunter/). I also have a [blog](https://www.austinhunter.dev/) where I'll be posting about things I'm learning or topics I am interested in (more posts to come after I graduate in December).

Currently working on:
* [Edukona](https://github.com/uncc-hice/edukona_backend) - A research project I'm contributing to at UNCC.
* [Quatro](https://github.com/AustinfHunter/quatro-backend) - My capstone project at UNCC.

Currently learning/expirementing with:
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
* [Redis](https://redis.com/)

Projects on pause (planning to continue working on them soon):
* [Freqy](https://github.com/AustinfHunter/freqy) - A project where I'm playing with DSP, specifically audio/radio stuff.
* [My blog](https://www.austinhunter.dev/) - Haven't had time to post anything recently. Also need to refactor things.
